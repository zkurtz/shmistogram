# shmistogram

A shmistogram is kind of like -- but better than -- a histogram. Enhancements include

- handle peak mode points with a separate multinomial probability mass function so that peak modes don't
obscured by membership in large bin
- support variable bin-width with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering routine

See `demo.ipynb` for examples.
