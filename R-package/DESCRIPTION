Description: The shmistogram is play on histogram that's designed to be more informative
    for messy univariate distributions. Key differences include (1) estimating 
    density with better accuracy and fewer bins than a histogram by 
    agglomerating points into variable-width bins and (2) emphasizing 
    singular modalities (i.e. point masses) with a separate multinomial 
    distribution.
