# shmistogram

The shmistogram is a better histogram. Key differences include

- estimating density with better accuracy and fewer bins than a histogram 
by using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering routine to build variable-width bins
- emphasizing singular modalities (i.e. point masses) with a separate multinomial distribution
