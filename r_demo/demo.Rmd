This document uses reticulate to access `shmistogram` from R and subsequently uses base graphics in R to prototype some shmistogram plots.

# Fake data example

One purpose for a shmistogram is to highlight ways in which a supposedly continuous variable may display discrete behaviour. For example, suppose we 
simulate a uniform distribution mixed with a few point masses. The histogram
obscures the point masses somewhat:

```{r }
set.seed(1)
unif = runif(n=100, min=-10, max=100)
multi = c(rep(0, 20), rep(42, 10), rep(NA, 2))
data = c(unif, multi)
hist(data, border=NA, col='grey')
```

In contrast, a shmistogram makes it more clear what is going on in the data:

```{r}
source("source.R")
shmistogram(data)
```
